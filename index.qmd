## Welcome

I'm a quantitative finance professional and data scientist with over five years of experience at T. Rowe Price, where I've led portfolio implementation for ETFs and multi-asset strategies, built internal APIs and analytical tools, and spearheaded quantitative research initiatives. I hold a CFA charter, a BS in Economics and BA in Mathematics from Duke University (Magna Cum Laude), and am completing an MS in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University with a focus on Data Science and Cloud Computing.

This site showcases my [coding projects](coding-projects.qmd) and [research work](research-projects.qmd). Feel free to explore, or jump straight to my [About page](about.qmd) for a full background.
